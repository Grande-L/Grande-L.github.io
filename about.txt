My name is Leonardo Salazar-Grande. I am a graphic design student at the University of Central Florida. Art has been a passion of mine for nearly 10 years, spanning from photography to illusration to web development. My dream is to be able to utilize my adoration of art to help change the world and to brighten the days of all those who need to see that there is beauty in even the most unlikely of places.
